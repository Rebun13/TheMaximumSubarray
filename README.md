# TheMaximumSubarray

## Description

We define subsequence as any subset of an array. We define a subarray as a contiguous subsequence in an array.

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

1. all nonempty subarrays.
2. all nonempty subsequences.

Print the two values as space-separated integers on one line.

Note that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered. 

## Returns

- int[2]: the maximum subarray and subsequence sums

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer _t_, the number of test cases.

- The first line of each test case contains a single integer _n_.
- The second line contains _n_ space-separated integers _arr[i]_ where _0 â‰¤ i < n_.
